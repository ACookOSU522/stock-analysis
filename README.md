### Green Stock Summary
The advantage in using a base code to refactor is that the basic structure is in place, and some research items are coded already. This provides a springboard for deep diving into the missing code pieces and fine tuning of the overall code to maximize efficiency in code run time.
Disadvantages to refactoring code are locating the missing pieces and establishing where the found pieces fit into the manipulated code. Starting with a broken code leads to a buffet of errors to troubleshoot and tease out for a smooth code.
